# Module One Final Project

## 🏀 2k19 Dream Team! 🏀

For our final project, we built a Command Line database application.

Our Command Line application utilizes the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) principles.

In the application there are three models, in a many-to-many relationship, with one join model.

Before we started building the application we sketched out all of the relationships between our models, built the tables and created user stories.
